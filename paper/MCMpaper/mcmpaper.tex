Traffic rule has a great impact on the efficiency and safety of a traffic system. Thus to build a model to evaluate the rule is of great importance. In most countries, there exists such a rule: unless overtaking another car, drivers are supposed to drive on the right-most lane. In our passage, we are trying to develop a model to evaluate this rule from two aspects: the traffic flow and the safety.
We construct a blank situation that is without the right-most rule. Using our model, we compare the safety and the traffic flow under the two situation, with the right-most rule and without the right-most rule.

To evaluate the safety, we build a model to calculate the safety distance. If the distance between two car is less than the safety distance. The collision will happen. The less the probability of the collision is, the safer. So we use the probablity of the collision to evaluate the
