\begin{abstract}
The model that we build is based on three points of view that includes safety, traffic flow and convenience judging from the difficulty level of the situation where a driver need to overtake the car before him.
In the part of safety factor, we first establish the concept of safety distance. As a hypothesis, we consider the safety can be always satisfied if nobody overtakes other cars on the road if the safety distance is always kept. So the dangerous situation happens on the condition of overtaking since the balance of distance could be broken. And the safety factor represents the possibility of a car crash when overtaking. It is judged by the probability we quantitatively calculated and depends on the traffic density. 
In the part of traffic flow, we design a method to analyze the relationship among the traffic flow, velocity, and traffic density, and finally find the function of traffic flow and traffic density. 
In the part of convenience, we design a method called “block model”. And this model is specially designed for the situation without the right-most rule. The difficulty level of overtaking will increase without the right-most rule. And this model is designed to measure the influence.\\
When the rule is carried out, it is only the normal lanes that are used mostly. So the traffic flow is judged by the normal lanes. However, if we don’t have such a rule, the overtaking lane will not exist, and it will become a normal lane. So the traffic flow will increase. And at the same time it may be less safe and less convenient. So we use the model of the quality of a road to measure this two condition and evaluate the performance of the road.
