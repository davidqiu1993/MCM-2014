\section{Introduction}

In bidirectional traffic, right- and left-hand traffic requires 
vehicles keep either to the right or the left side of the road, 
respectively.\cite{Draper_Geoff_1993} The first right-hand 
traffic law in United State dates back to 1792, applied to the 
Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike.\cite{Weingroff_Richard_2014}\\

The right-hand traffic rule derives regulations on multi-lane 
freeways, which often requires drivers to drive in the 
right-most lane unless they are passing another vehicle, in 
which case they move one lane to the left, pass, and return 
to their former travel lane. The overtaking lane provides 
redundant convenience and safety for vehicles to pass others, 
but lowers freeway's traffic flow capability.\\

Different models may exist that provide a better tradeoff 
among traffic flow, safety and convenience. This paper 
considers these three criteria, introduces a different 
freeway traffic model and analyses performances of the two 
models.

\section{Performance Evaluation}

Performance of a traffic rule is determined by the three 
creteria below: 
\paragraph{Safety} xxxxx
\paragraph{Traffic Flow} xxxxxxxxx
\paragraph{Convenience} xxxxxxx

\subsection{Safety Factor}

\emph{Assumptions}
The value of acceleration subjects to normal distribution, $\mu = \frac{max(a)}{2}$,
$\sigma = \frac{1}{4}\mu$, for $p(0 < a_2 < \frac{1}{4} \mu)$ and $p(\frac{7}{4} \mu < a_2 < 2\mu)$ is very small.

\paragraph{Safe Distance Model}

On the highway, if the car in front suddenly slows down, it is likely that a car crash happens.
We build this model to calculate the safe distance between two adjacent cars. That is ,
if the adjacent $d \leq l$ and the car in front suddenly slows down,the accident will not happen.\\ \\
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Parameter & Description\\
\hline
$a_1$ & the acceleration of the  car in behind \\
$v_1$ & the velocity of the  car in front \\
$a_2$ & the acceleration of the car in front \\
$v_1$ & the velocity of the  car in front \\
$t_r$ & the driver's reaction time \\
$t$ & the total time whole process \\
$l$ & the safe distance \\
$d$ & a constant which is the real distance between the car in front and the car in behind.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Model parameter}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[h]
\small
\centering
\includegraphics{situation.png}
\caption{} %\label{fig::collision}
\end{figure}

There are two possible situations that the accident will happen:
\begin{itemize}
\item The accident happens after the car in front stopped.
That is, when
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{v_2}{a_2}  \geq  \frac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r
\end{displaymath}
We have:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{v_1^2 - v_0 ^ 2}{2a_1} + v_1 t_r - l & = & \frac{v_2 ^ 2 - v_0 ^ 2}{2a_2}\\
\frac{v_2 - v_0}{a_2} & = & t\\
\frac{v_1 - v_0}{a_1} & = & t - t_r
\end{eqnarray}
\item The collision happens before the car in front stopped. That is, when
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{v_2}{a_2}  >  \frac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r
\end{displaymath}
We have:
\begin{eqnarray}
v_1 t_r + \frac{v_1 ^ 2}{2a_1} - l& = &\frac{v_2^2}{2a_2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}

Solve this equation array, we have
\begin{displaymath}
l(a_1, a_2, v_1, v_2) = 
\left \{
\begin{array}{cl}
\dfrac{(a_1a_2t_r^2 + 2a_1t_rv_2 + v_1^2 - 2v_1v_2 + v_2^2)}{2(a_1-a_2)} & \dfrac{v_2}{a_2}  \geq \dfrac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r \\
v_2 t_r + \dfrac{v_1 ^ 2}{2a_1} -\dfrac{v_2^2}{2a_2} & \dfrac{v_2}{a_2}  < \dfrac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r
\end{array}
\right .
\end{displaymath}
\\

To calculate $l_{max}$, firstly, we are going to find the extrema,

\begin{displaymath}
\left \{
\begin{array}{cl}
\dfrac{\partial l}{\partial{a_1}} = 0 \\
\dfrac{\partial l}{\partial{a_2}} = 0 \\
\dfrac{\partial l}{\partial{v_1}} = 0 \\
\dfrac{\partial l}{\partial{v_2}} = 0 \\
\end{array}
\right .
\end{displaymath}

This equation array has no solution, which indicates that we can get the $l_{max}$ at the boundary of domain.

$l$ reaches the maximum when $a_1$ equals to $a_{min}$, { }$v_1$ equals to $v_{1max}$, $v_2$ equals to $v_{2min}$. (If the front car drives with the lowest speed, the rear car drives with the highest speed, and at the same time, rear car's acceleration is the minimum, when emergency happens, the braking distance is the longest.)

Thus, we have:
\begin{displaymath}
l_{max}(a_2) = 
\left \{
\begin{array}{cl}
\dfrac{(a_{min}a_2t_r^2 + 2a_{min}t_rv_{min} + v_{max}^2 - 2v_{max}v_{min} + v_{min}^2)}{2(a_{min}-a_2)} & \dfrac{v_{min}}{a_2}  \geq \dfrac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r \\
v_{min} t_r + \dfrac{v_{max} ^ 2}{2a_{min}} -\dfrac{v_{min}^2}{2a_2} & \dfrac{v_2}{a_2}  < \dfrac{v_1}{a_1} + t_r
\end{array}
\right .
\end{displaymath}\\

\paragraph{$l${ } Distribution}
From the result above, we can get $a_2(l)$

%\usepackage{amsmath}
\[ a_2(l) = \begin{cases}
-\dfrac{v_{max}^2 - 2v_{max}v_{min} + 2a_{min}t_rv_{max} + v_{min}^2 - 2a_{min}t_rv_{min} - 2la_{min}}{a_{min}t_r^2 + 2l}, 
\\

\quad l \leq \dfrac{v_{max}^2 - v_{max}v_{min} + 2v_{max}a_{min}t_r - a_{min} v_{min}t_r}{2a_{min}}\\
\dfrac{a_{min}v_{min}^2}{v_{max}^2 + 2a_{min}t_rv_{max} - 2la_{min}}, \quad  l > \dfrac{v_{max}^2 - v_{max}v_{min} + 2v_{max}a_{min}t_r - a_{min} v_{min}t_r}{2a_{min}}
\end{cases}\]
\\
\paragraph{Safety Factor $\alpha$}
For every car, it has a unique safety factor $\alpha$, the closer the distance between two adjacent cars is, the smaller the $\alpha$ is, vice versa.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\small
\centering
\includegraphics{draw_SafetyNormalDistribution_graph.png}
\caption{safety factor distribution} \label{fig::safety factor distribution}
\end{figure}
\begin{displaymath}
\alpha(l) = \int_{0}^{l} f(x) dx.
\end{displaymath}
%\textbf{Assumptions}\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item d is the distance between two adjacent cars.
%\end{itemize}
We can see that , when $a_2$ = 0, that is, the front car has the lowest deceleration. Since $l(a)$ is a monotone increasing function, at this time,$l$ is minimal. In other word, it is of little possibility that the distance is less than the l, that is, $\alpha(l) \rightarrow 0$                     

\subsection{traffic flow}
Since the layout of the cars on the freeway is complicated, to simplify, we use a special model to discuss the relationship between the safety and traffic flow under the situation with and without the right-most rule.
\\
\paragraph{Assumption}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item the rest flow on a single lane drive with a constant speed.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Parameter & Discription\\
\hline
$k$ & The traffic density\\
$k_j$ & The traffic density under the traffic jam condition\\
$k_m$ & The traffic density when the the traffic flow is the highest.\\
$v_f$ & The velocity when the traffic density is small \\
$Q$ & Traffic flow \\
%$N$ & The total number of the car on the freeway
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Model parameter}
\end{table}

%\subsection{Con Model}
%\paragraph{Assumption}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Only one car are overtaking, the others are driving with a constant speed
%\item Every overtaking, pass only one car
%\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
J^* = J_{supply} - J_{need}
\end{equation}

\[ J^* = \begin{cases}
0,\\
\bar{l} - \bar{l}_{max}
\end{cases}\]

%\item Without the right-most rule, there is no overtaking lane, vehicle can stay on either lane at any time.
%\item On the freeway, except the overtaking car, others are subject to the uniform distribution.
%\end{itemize}


\begin{displaymath}
\beta = A\beta_1 + B\beta_2
\end{displaymath}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
%\begin{displaymath}
%\beta_1 = \frac{J_1 - J_2}{J_2}
%\end{displaymath}
%\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Parameter & Meaning\\
\hline
$J$ & traffic flow\\
$J_1$ & the supply traffic flow \\
$J_2$ & the demand traffic flow \\
$s$ & the lenth of a car \\
$l$ & the safe distance \\
$\bar{v}$ & the average velocity\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
